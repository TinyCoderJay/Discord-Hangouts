<h3> <u> Summary </u> </h3>
<p> Rather than try to update this website frequently to keep up with the changing statistics, I have a bot in my server that compiles all of the servers statistics into an easy to use dashboard for everyone to see. This summary includes member-flow, message count, voice channel count in minutes, and other things too. The bot does have some downtime, which means that it can be inacuate. <br> <a href="https://statbot.net/dashboard/704518749792764004">Click here to view a summary of the server's statistics</a> </p>

<h3> <u> Member Stats </u> </h3>
<p> Currently, the server has 277 members. It will most likely change by the time this website is published, but to see the current member count and member-flow, <a href="https://statbot.net/dashboard/704518749792764004">Click here.</a>

<h3> <u> Message/Voice Stats </u> </h3>
<p> This server at its peak has hit highs of over 4,400 messages in 1 day. That is an extremely impressive amount, and is difficult for servers with thousands of members. Currently, the message average is over 1000 as of the last website update. To see an updated daily message count, <a href="https://statbot.net/dashboard/704518749792764004/messages">Click here.<a> <br> <br> When it comes to voice channel time, it is much more inconsistent. Some days, the voice channels have been used for over 20 hours in a 24 hour period. Other days, the voice channels have not been used at all. It just depends on what days members decide they want to get together and hangout, play games, or listen to music with a bot. To see an updated voice channel time graph, <a href="https://statbot.net/dashboard/704518749792764004/voice">Click here.</a>
  
<h3> <u>Other Server Stats</u> </h3>
<p> This bot records many other server statistics as well that I have decided not to go into detail about. You can find them all in <a href="https://statbot.net/dashboard/704518749792764004">Our dashboard.<a> Go check them out!

<h3> <u>Leveling Stats</u> </h3>
<p> Discord Hangouts has a leveling system. We use a bot called <a href="https://arcanebot.xyz/">Arcane</a> The more you talk, the more you level up. You get special perks depending on how high your level is. To check the server's level leaderboard, <a href="https://arcanebot.xyz/leaderboard/704518749792764004">Click here.</a>
