  <h3>  <u>About the Server</u>  </h3>
  <p> <strong>Discord Hangouts</strong> is a community-based Discord server with over 350 members. It was founded on April 27, 2020 by me (WheezyBread63 #0001 on discord). This server has a steady growth rate of about 3-10 members a day. Although the server has this steady growth rate, it has hit highs of 50 new members in one day.</p>

  <h3> <u> How it came About </u> </h3>
  <p>  - The way that <strong>Discord Hangouts</strong> was made is actually quite interesting. I (the creator) used it as a test server (called "Test Server") to try bots, features before adding them to a server that I co-owned with my friend. <br> <br> 
  - It was his server, but I was made co-owner because of how I improved the server by using my test server. Then, we wanted to increase the member flow. At the time, it was probably 1 new person every 3 days, and some of them left after a glance which of course happens in every growing server. <br> <br> 
  - So, I looked into Partner Bot. It was a bot that posted your server ad in other servers that had the bot. I added it to my test server to see how it was. After that, I forgot about it and went onto another project.  <br> <br> 
  - A few days later, People started joining my test server. I didn't know how, until I remembered the partner bot. I don't know why people joined a server called "Test Server", but they did. After getting 10 people, and good feedback from them, I decided to remodel it into a proper community server. Since then, it has grown more that I ever thought it would.
